<h3>Development Notes</h3>
<i>About the Jam</i>
<p>&emsp;Godot Wild Jam #74 took place on October 11, 2024. The main theme was "Haunted", with three optional themes or design elements called "Wildcards". I opted to use the Wildcard "It's Broken - The player needs to repair and/or restore something". All participants had until October 20, 2024 to design, develop, test, and publish their submissions.</p>

<i>Game Design Overview</i>
<p>&emsp;It's Halloween! Or, close enough. As a fan of horror, I was excited to participate and play other participants' submissions for this jam. I had also been wanting to try my hand at a point-and-click style game, having just played the entire Myst series. Trying my hand at the basics seemed like a good idea during a jam. The idea for this one came quickly once I saw the Wildcards. What I ended up creating for the scene was essentially what I had seen in my head except for the doll's design. She was originally going to be much more ambiguous in style but I liked the idea of making a nod to the Sadako hair-over-the-face look.</p>
<p>&emsp;The room came together through trial and error, considering what could create plausible interactions for the player to figure out, a little bit of just making decisions and hoping that they worked, and an attempt to prevent the possible interactions from getting too large in scope. I ended up drawing a flow chart of the object interactions, specifically to ensure that I wouldn't accidentally create extra complexity.</p>
